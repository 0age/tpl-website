                            <h2>Motivation</h2>
                            <p class="lead">While blockchain technology has steadily matured over the last few years, significant challenges remain, in particular towards integration with the traditional financial system. This process, however, might be at risk if driven from outside the system as institutions will naturally favor the status quo. Integration must be led by the community, having clear guidelines on how to onboard institutional players. TPL is a first approach in this direction, providing a self-regulatory framework to support formal decentralized economies while preserving users’ freedom to assemble and innovate.</p>
                            <p class="lead">Clear guidelines for safe and reliable economic exchange are necessary to prevent malicious behavior within an economy. While government regulation works well enough for legacy economic exchange, it suffers from the inherent weakness of having a single party in control of passing, running and enforcing mandatory laws within a jurisdiction. What is needed is an open regulatory system that is governed by the network and enforced on-chain, allowing trusted parties to transact with each other securely.</p>

                            <h2>About TPL</h2>
                            <p class="lead">TPL is a self-regulatory framework to support formal decentralized economies while preserving users’ freedom to assemble and innovate. Unlike other approaches, TPL is opt-in, decentralized, and enforced on-chain, allowing trusted parties to transact with each other securely.</p>
                            <p class="lead">In TPL, token-holders are validated via KYC-AML processes, mirroring the ICANN process for domain validation which everyone is already familiar with. Projects introduce various token-holder validation requirements, which are built-in within the token smart contract code. The protocol then validates these requirements on-chain for every participant in transaction, and approves or rejects the transaction accordingly. In this way, TPL allows any project to guarantee regulatory compliance in every single exchange between participants, and not just in the initial offering.</p>

                            <h2>Protocol Design</h2>
                            <p class="lead">Peer-to-peer networks can be regarded as virtual jurisdictions. A Root Authority Decentralized Autonomous Organization (RootDAO) is an entity that governs and manages rules within a jurisdiction. The RootDAO elects Certificate Authorities (CAs) to attest participant’s identity by performing KYC-AML compliance due diligence and investor accreditation. Participants rely on CA-signed certificates to transact with other trusted members. The open-source nature of RootDAOs allows for the creation of multiple jurisdictions to fulfill the needs of different networks. </p>
                            <p class="lead">In the case of an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), a project can adhere to a specific jurisdiction, and require participants to hold certificates asserting their accredited investor status and their ability to operate under a particular country’s law.</p>

                            <h2>Implementation</h2>
                            <p class="lead">A RootDAO governs a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain that mirrors the chain of trust of certificates.</p>
                            <p class="lead">This smart contract-based registry allows any smart contract to easily check that a participant is indeed part of the jurisdiction by querying this on-chain registry, rather than cryptographically verifying the authenticity of the certificate chain. Additionally, having all certificate info in a single smart contract facilitates certificate revocation.</p>
                            <p class="lead">The logic for transaction approval can be automated and built-in within the smart contract code of a token or an exchange. This mechanism allows any project to ensure that not only their ICO will be compliant, but also any subsequent transactions of their asset between any third parties since the contract itself can reject any operations from unauthorized users.</p>
